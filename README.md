🎙️ AI Voice Assistant in Python
An intelligent, privacy-focused voice assistant built using Python, capable of performing common tasks such as playing music, retrieving information from Wikipedia, and telling the current time — all with natural voice commands.

🧠 Introduction
The AI Voice Assistant is a desktop-based smart assistant designed for everyday use. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities to interact with users via voice, allowing hands-free control for various simple tasks. The assistant processes data locally, ensuring that user privacy and security are never compromised.

This project demonstrates the integration of AI, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and automation in a simple Python application. It’s an ideal project for students, beginners in AI, and developers interested in voice technology.

🎯 Objectives
Develop a smart AI assistant using Python.

Enable voice-based interaction with the system.

Provide real-time functionalities such as:

Playing music from the web.

Fetching summaries from Wikipedia.

Telling the current time.

Ensure user data privacy by avoiding cloud-based processing.

🚀 Key Features
Feature	Description
🔊 Voice Interaction	Interacts with the user using voice commands and replies in speech.
🎵 Play Music	Recognizes the song name and plays it using YouTube.
📚 Wikipedia Search	Fetches summaries of topics from Wikipedia and reads them out.
⏰ Current Time	Tells the current time in a conversational manner.
🔐 Privacy Focused	All commands are processed locally; no data is sent to external servers.
🧩 Modular Design	Clean, structured Python code for scalability and future improvements.

🖥️ Technologies Used
Python 3.8+

SpeechRecognition – Recognizes spoken input from the microphone

pyttsx3 – Converts text into human-like speech

PyAudio – Captures audio from the system microphone

Wikipedia API – For fetching topic summaries

datetime module – To retrieve and format current system time

webbrowser module – Opens YouTube or browser to play songs

📥 Installation Guide
Follow these steps to set up the project on your system:

✅ Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above

Internet connection (for Wikipedia & song playback)

Microphone and speakers

pip package manager

🔧 Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/AGRIMRANA80/AI_Voice_Assistant.git
cd AI_Voice_Assistant
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Assistant:

bash
Copy
Edit
python assistant.py
Once the assistant is running, it will greet you and wait for voice commands like:

“Play [song name]”

“Tell me about [topic]”

“What is the time?”

🧪 Example Commands
Try saying:

“Play Shape of You”

“What is Python?”

“Tell me about Mahatma Gandhi”

“What time is it?”

🛡️ Privacy Policy
This application is built with a privacy-first approach. No user data is stored, tracked, or transmitted to any server. All audio processing is done locally on your device.

Unlike commercial voice assistants that may send audio to the cloud for processing, this assistant ensures your voice data remains private and secure.
